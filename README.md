# VICreg-Self-Supervised-Learning-of-Visual-Representations


This repository contains the implementation of VICReg: Variance, Invariance, and Covariance Regularization for Self-Supervised Learning. The purpose of this project is to explore and implement the techniques described in the VICReg paper for learning visual representations in a self-supervised manner.
